Exercise 1- Number guessing game

For this exercise:
- Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments.
- When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
- Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
- Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
    - Too high
    - Too low
    - Just right
- If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwirse, ghe user is asked to try again
- The program only exists after the user guesses correctly
