For this exercise:

Write a function (run_timing) that tracks and calculates the average time for a 10 km run.
The function should repeatedly prompt the user to enter the time (in minutes) it took to complete a 10 km run.
The user can stop entering data by pressing Enter without typing a number.
Once the user stops entering data, the function should:
Calculate the average time of all entered run times.
Display the average as a floating-point number and the total number of runs.
Example usage and expected outputs are shown below:

Input:

Enter 10 km run time: 15
Enter 10 km run time: 20
Enter 10 km run time: 10
Enter 10 km run time:
